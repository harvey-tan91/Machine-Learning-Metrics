# Machine Learning Metrics
 
This repository contain functions to produce summary reports for machine learning solutions.

# Motivation

I found myself rewriting alot of the same code to produce metrics when developing machine learning solutions for different problems. 
 

Some functions include:
1) grid_search_result_summary

1a) This function produce a high-level summary on the Grid Search object

2) classifier_performance_report

2a) This function produce a high-level summary of a binary classifier such as the accuracy, precision, recall rate and etc.
