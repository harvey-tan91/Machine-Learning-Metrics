# Machine Learning Metrics
 
This repository contain functions to produce summary reports for machine learning solutions.

# Motivation

I found myself rewriting alot of the same code to produce metrics when developing machine learning solutions for different problems. 
 
Some of the functions that can be found in this repository includes:
1) grid_search_result_summary
#This function produce a high-level summary on the Grid Search object

2) classifier_performance_report
#This function produce a high-level summary of a binary classifier such as the accuracy, precision, recall rate and etc.
